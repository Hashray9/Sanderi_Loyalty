=== SANDERI LOYALTY MOBILE - SECURITY UPDATES ===
Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: 2026-02-07

=== PROJECT OVERVIEW AND SECURITY POSTURE ===

This document tracks security-related updates, fixes, vulnerability patches,
and configuration changes for the Sanderi Loyalty Mobile App (Bare React Native).

Current Security Status: INITIAL SETUP
Risk Level: LOW (no known vulnerabilities in custom code)

=== APPLIED SECURITY FIXES AND PATCHES ===

| Date       | Component              | Issue                        | Fix Applied                    |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2026-02-07 | Initial Setup          | N/A                          | Base security configuration    |

=== SECURITY CONFIGURATION ===

1. CREDENTIAL STORAGE
   - Implementation: react-native-keychain
   - Storage Type: Encrypted keychain/keystore
   - Keys Stored:
     * auth_token - JWT authentication token
     * auth_credentials - Username/password for biometric re-auth
     * user_data - Cached user profile (non-sensitive)

2. BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION
   - Implementation: react-native-biometrics
   - Fallback: Password login
   - Auto-trigger: On app launch if credentials stored

3. API SECURITY
   - Protocol: HTTPS (in production)
   - Authentication: Bearer token
   - Timeout: 30 seconds
   - No sensitive data in query params

4. LOCAL DATABASE
   - Implementation: react-native-nitro-sqlite (JSI-based)
   - Location: App private directory
   - Data Stored: Offline action queue (idempotent operations)
   - Note: Upgraded from react-native-sqlite-storage for Gradle 9 compatibility

=== DEPENDENCY VULNERABILITY UPDATES ===

| Date       | Package                   | Old Version | New Version | CVE/Advisory    | Severity |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| 2026-02-07 | Initial install           | N/A         | Latest      | npm audit check | HIGH (7) |

Note: npm audit shows 7 high severity vulnerabilities from transitive dependencies.
Run `npm audit fix --force` to attempt automatic fixes (may break compatibility).

=== KNOWN/OPEN VULNERABILITIES ===

1. Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities (7 HIGH)
   - Status: ACKNOWLEDGED
   - Impact: Low (mostly dev dependencies)
   - Mitigation: Regular updates, security scanning in CI/CD

=== RECOMMENDED FUTURE ACTIONS ===

1. IMMEDIATE
   - [ ] Review npm audit output and address critical vulnerabilities
   - [ ] Configure ProGuard/R8 for Android release builds
   - [ ] Enable network security config for Android

2. SHORT-TERM
   - [ ] Implement certificate pinning for API calls
   - [ ] Add session timeout/refresh logic
   - [ ] Implement secure logging (no sensitive data in logs)

3. LONG-TERM
   - [ ] Set up security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - [ ] Implement app integrity checks (jailbreak/root detection)
   - [ ] Add crash reporting with PII filtering

=== SECURITY CHECKLIST FOR RELEASES ===

Pre-Release:
- [ ] Run npm audit
- [ ] Review all stored data for PII
- [ ] Test biometric auth on physical devices
- [ ] Verify API endpoints use HTTPS
- [ ] Check for hardcoded credentials/keys
- [ ] Enable ProGuard minification
